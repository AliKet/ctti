Compile Time Type Information for the C++ programming language.

## Background

We know C++ is a statically typed compiled language, but it's disappointing that we cannot even get
the name of a C++ type at compile time, having to use RTTI (Run Time Type Information) which introduces
a lot of overhead. In fact, that's one of the most feared features of C++, usually disabled in performance dependent
scenarios such as videogames programming.

This library aims to provide features similar to RTTI `std::type_info` at compile-time, currently `constexpr` type name and
a `constexpr` replacement of `std::type_index` for indexing maps with types.

``` cpp
#include "ctti/type_id.hpp"

int main()
{
    static_assert(ctti::type_id<int>() != ctti::type_id("hello"), "compile-time type-id comparison");

    std::unordered_map<ctti::type_id_t, std::size_t> sizeof_map;

    sizeof_map[ctti::type_id<int>()] = sizeof(int);
}
```

## Support and current status

This was tested on Visual Studio 2015, GCC 5.2.0 and Clang 3.6.2. It's fairly unstable (We are currently working on it), and it leads
to ugly ICEs whenever the `constexpr` machinery fails.

#### Current state: Bugs...

Currently you cannot access to the raw `constexpr` string pointer of type names, instead you should work with `ctti::detail::string`  constexpr class. Because the way type names are computed, these strings are not correctly null-terminated. Note `ctti::detail::string` has the usual `operator<<(std::ostream&)` for working with output streams. Use it to print type names and convert to `std::string` at runtime:

``` cpp
std::cout << ctti::type_id<int>().name() << std::endl;
```
